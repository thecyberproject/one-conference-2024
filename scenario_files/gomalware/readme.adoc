= EncrypzzMalware

== Development 

Under the hood we use https://gioui.org/doc/install/linux[Gioui] as a front-end GUI library for cross platform Dummy malware. As such, if you want to build this project you would need the following packages. More documentation is provided as the Gioui website.

```bash
apt install gcc pkg-config libwayland-dev libx11-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libgles2-mesa-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libffi-dev libxcursor-dev libvulkan-dev
```

== Scenario
The dummymalware uses a pre-defined public-key for encrypting the fies. 
The password for the encryption is:

`helloworld`
